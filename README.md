Mars Game

Team members:
- Mohammed Gathoo
- Tristan Bookhan
- Nico Govindsamy

Basic Premise:
You are an astronaut and scientist that currently resides on a mars base camp that consists of:
- the scientist's quarters / lab facilities
- manufacturing facility
- outside the base camp; the rocket ship on its landing platform


You awake to the sounds of alarms going off in the base camp and red flashing lights signalling a
security threat in the base. There is a severe sand storm occuring outside the facility. Upon closer
investigation, you find that the AI security system has gone rogue and is trying to attack any organic
lifeforms on the base. You need to first escape the lab section by solving some puzzles, then make
your way through the manufacturing facility by fighting and dodging the laser turrets on the walls, and finally
fight through the AI security robots outside, in the sand storm, and make your way to the rocket ship to escape
Mars.
